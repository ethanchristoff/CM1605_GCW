            <h3> Form Page</h3>
            <p>I had referred to the use of the form elements present in HTML to design the form present in that page, however this had also included the use of java script to implement the functionality of the form such that when it's clicked an actual function is carried out. Aside from that, I had referred to the use of CSS to beautify the page and make it look more professional.</p>

            <h3> Quiz Page</h3>
            <p>In terms of how I had created the quiz page, I had referred to the key use of CSS and HTML to design the placholder segment of the quiz. Afterwards, I had initiated a simple logic in the java script to swap each question and answer out for an element from a two_dimensional array.</p>

            <h3> Home page</h3>
            <p>In terms of designing the home page, there were many CSS elements that had been referred to for the beautification process. Thereafter there was a bit of java script included to cache the users details into the page such that it may be shown on the top right of the page when needed.</p>
